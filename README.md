Old School BIOS Generator for A9LH Nintendo 3DS

I decided to improve the way that @sebascontre generates the images.
The generator script just takes the input of the HTML site and creates text via imagettftext() PHP function, then generates the output image.

Work in progress. 

Be gentle, the website works in a RaspberryPi 2.
